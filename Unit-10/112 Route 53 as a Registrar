a domain name registrar is an organization that manages the reservation of internet domain names:

eg: GoDaddy, Google Domains, Route53;

DOMAIN REGISTRAR != DNS

If you buy your domain on 3rd Party website,you can still use Route53.
 
 1) Create a hosted Zone in Route53.
 2) Update NS records on 3rd party website to use Route 53 name servers.
