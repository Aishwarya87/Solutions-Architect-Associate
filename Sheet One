1) Use the IAM role because it uses temporary security credentials.

2) Vault Operations in Amazon Glacier - use amazon SNS, SQS, asynchronous

4) 256 kb *4 = IOPS

5) in amazon route 53, cannot create a hosted zone on top level domain.

6) the total volume of data and num of archives can store are unlimited in Amazon Glacier.

7) Add a bucket policy to the bucket to minimize the task of assigning to each bucket.

17) To create a snapshot for amazon ebs volumes that serve as root devices(c drive, linux), you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.

18) Updates to DB are synchronously replicated across multi AZs; combats failover

19) Execution Role: permissions on lambda.

20) cannot access --> bucket policies || iam user policy

21) amazon sqs is a distributed .

22) /dev/sda1  : reserved for the root device.

23) the settings will be effective immediately for security groups.
