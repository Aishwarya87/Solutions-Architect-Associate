EBS volumes are network drives with good but limited performance.
if you need a high performance hardware disk, use EC2 instance store.

these lose their storage if theyre stopped(ephemeral).
therefore, good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content.

for long term storage, EBS.

Local ec2 Instance Store: Very high IOPS.
