6 types:
1) gp2/gp3(SSD): general purpose
    cost effective, low latency
    gp3 can independently set the IOPS and throughput individually
    for gp2, they are linked together


2) Provisioned IOPS SSD:
use case: critical business aplication with sustained IOPS performance, DATABASE WORKLOADS, supports ebs multi attach.
io1/io2(SSD): highest performance SSD 
    independent like gp3

3) Hard disk Drives: MAX throughput, cannot be a boot volume
   st1(HDD): low cost HDD
   sc1(HDD): lowest cost

EBS volumes characterized in size, throughput, IOPS(I/O ops per sec)

OVER 32000 IOPS: EC2 NITRO WITH IO1 OR IO2.
