Elastic File System

1) managed NFS(network file system) that can be mounted on many ec2s.
2) works with ec2 instances in multi-AZ
3) all ec2 instances can have the access to the same file usng EFS.
4) USES NFSv4.1 protocol 
5) uses security group to contol access to EFS. 
6) COMPATIBLE WITH LINUX BASED AMI(NOT WINDOWS).


PERFORMANCE MODE:set at EFS creation time.
1) general purpose: low latency
2) MAX I/O: higher latency, throughput, highly parallel.

THROUGHPUT MODE:
1) Bursting
2) provisioned: small file system but need very high throughput.

STORAGE TIERS(lifecycle management feature - move file after N days):
1) standard: for frequently accessed files.
2) infrequent access(EFS-IA): lower price.
