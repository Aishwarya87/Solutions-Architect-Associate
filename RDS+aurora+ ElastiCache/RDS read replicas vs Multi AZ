RDS read replicas for read scalability:
  upto 5 read replicas
  within AZ,Cross AZ, or cross region
  Replication is ASYNC: eventually consistent.
  Read replicas are used for SELECT(=read) statements(not insert,update,delete)
  
  In aws, theres a network cost when data goes from one AZ to other.
  For RDS read replicas within the same region(differentAZ), you dont pay that fee.
  us-east-1(region)
  1a,1b-AZs
  
  
RDS multi AZ(Disaster Recovery):
  SYNC replication
  one DNS name(automatic failover): if master gets crashed, then standby also crashes.
  Increase availability
  Not used for scaling(no read/write supported in instance standby)
  CAN SETUP THE READ REPLICAS AS MULTI AZ.
  
  
RDS from single AZ to multi AZ:
  just click on "modify" for the database.
  Internally:
  a snapshot is taken and that is restored to create a standby DB.
  Synchronization is established between the two databases.
