Using ElastiCache involves heavy application code changes.

DB Cache:
if cache misses in the amazon ElastiCache, then application fetches the data from Amazon RDS.
and then writes to cache.

HELPS RELIEVE LOAD IN RDS.

invalidation strategy to make sure only the most current data is used in there.

USER SESSION STORE:


CLUSTER ENGINE:
Redis Versus MemCached:
Redis: Multi AZ with auto-failover, read replicas and have high availability, backup and restore features.
MemCached: No high Availability(replication), non-persistent,no backup and restore, multi-threaded , distributed


SSL authentication

CACHE SECURITY:
  All caches in elastiCache DO NOT SUPPORT IAM AUTHENTICATION.
  
  RedisAUTH
  memcached:Supports SASL based authentication(advanced).


LazyLoading: when you dont have cache hit, then you load the data into the cache.
WriteThrough: no stale data
Session Store: Using TTL features.

Redis Use Case:Gaming leaderboards using redis SortedSets guarantees both uniqueness and element ordering
