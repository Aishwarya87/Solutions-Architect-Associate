S3- KMS limitation:

  When you upload, it calls the GenerateDtaKey KMS api
  When you download, it calls the Decrypt KMS api.
  
  We have KMS quota per second based on region. and if restricted, cannot request a quota increase in KMS.
  
s3 Performance:
  Multi Part Upload: recommended for files> 100Mb
                     must use for files>5 GB.
                     
      parallelizes uploads; speeds up transfers.
      
      
  s3 Tranfer Acceleration: for upload/download
    minimzes the amount of public internet that we go through and we maximize the amount of private aws network that we go through.
    
  s3 Byte Range fetches: USED TO SPEED UP DOWNLOADS. parallelizes GETS.
                         RETREIVE ONLY PARTIAL DATA. (for eg: the head of the file).
