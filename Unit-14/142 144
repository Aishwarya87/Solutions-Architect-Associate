Access Logs:
Warning: Do not set your logging bucket to be the application bucket otherwise
  it will create a logging loop and your bucket will grow in size exponentially.
  
S3 Replication:
  CRR and SRR(Cross region replication || same region replication)
  
  1) MUST ENABLE VERSIONING in source and destination
  2) Buckets can be in different accounts.
  3) Copying is asynchronous.
  4) must give proper IAM permissions to s3.
  5) CRR use cases: compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts.
  6) SRR: log aggregation, live replication. 
  
  After activating, only the new objects are replicated.
  Any delete operation is NOT replicated.
  No chaining(transitivity) in replication.
