There is over 100,000 files in your S3 bucket, amounting to 50TB of data. how can you build this index efficiently?

1
Use the RDS Import feature to load the data from S3 to PostgreSQL, and run a SQL query to build the index
2
Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, read all the files one by one, extract the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS.
3
Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, issue a Byte Range Fetch for the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS.
4
Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, use S3 select to get the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS.


Correct Answer


3
Create an application that will traverse the S3 bucket, issue a Byte Range Fetch for the first 250 bytes, and store that information in RDS.
