Transition objects bw storage classes.

For infrequent accessed object, move them to Standard_IA.

For archive objects you dont need in real time, GLACIER or DEEP ARCHIVE.

TRANSITION ACTIONS: 

EXPIRATION ACTIONS: configure objects to delete after some time. 
  can also be used to DELETE OLD VERSIONS of file(if versioning is enabled).
  
Scenario 1:
  Your application on ec2 creates images thumbnails after profile photos are uploaded to amazon S3. These thumbnails can be easily recreated, and only need to be kept for 45 days.
  The source images should be able to able to be immediately retrieved for these 45 days and afterwards, the user can wait upto 6 hours. How would you design tthis?
  
  s3 source images can be on STANDARD with a lifecycle config to transition them to glacier after 45 days[archived + 6 hours]
  
  s3 thumbnails on ONEZONE-IA[recreated] with a lifecycle config to expire them after 45 days.
  
Scenario 2:
  A rule in your company states that you should be able to recover your s3 objects immediately for 15days, althoough this may happen very rarely. 
  After this time and for upto 365 days, deleted objects should be recoverable within 48 hours. 
  
  You need to enable s3 versioning in order to have object versions, so that "deleted objects" are in fact hidden by a "delete marker" and can be recovered.
  
  You can transition these "noncurrent versions" of the object to S3_IA.
  
  You can transition afterwards these "noncurrentversions" to DEEP ARCHIVE.
