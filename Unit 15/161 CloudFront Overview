Content Delivery Network(CDN)

data is cached locally in edge locations[over private AWS network].

Improves read performance.

Origins: 
  s3 bucket: Enhanced secuirty w CF OAI[origin access identity] + s3 bucket policy: in order to access the origin
  custom origin(HTTP): ec2 instances, load balancers;
  
The client first requests the edge location through public internet. The edge location then requests the origin and caches up data through private internet. 
The next time the client requests, the EL first looks up in cache before requesting the origin.

These origins[ if ec2 instances] must be public. 

if Load balancers; then these should be PUBLIC but instances at the backend can now be private.

CF Geo Restriction:
  WhiteList
  BlackList
  Use case: Copyright Laws to control access to content.
  
Great for static content that must be available everywhere. 

s3 Cross Region Replication: Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low-latency in few regions.
