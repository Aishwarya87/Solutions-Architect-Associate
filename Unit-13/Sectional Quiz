Question 1




My EC2 Instance does not have the permissions to perform an API call PutObject on S3. What should I do?

1
I should run `aws configure` and insert my personal credentials, because I have access to PutObject on S3
2
I should ask an administrator to attach a Policy to the IAM Role on my EC2 Instance that authorises it to do the API call
3
I should export the environment variables with my credentials on the EC2 Instance
4
I should use the EC2 Metadata API call


Correct Answer

Question 3




I need my colleagues help to debug my code. When he runs the application on his machine, it's working fine, whereas I get API authorisation exceptions. What should I do?

Send him my AWS access key and secret key so he can replicate the issue on his machine
2
Ask him to send me his credentials so I can start working
3
Compare his IAM policy and my IAM policy in the policy simulator to understand the differences
4
Ask him to create an EC2 server and puts his credentials there so I can run the application from the EC2 Instance
