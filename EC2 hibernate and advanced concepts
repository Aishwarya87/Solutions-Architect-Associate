stop: the data on disk(EBS) is kept intact in the next start.
terminate: ebs volumes(root)

first start: the OS boots and the ec2 user data script is run.
following starts: the OS boots up
this takes time

ec2 hibernate:
the in-memory(RAM) state is preserved.
the instance boot is faster since OS not stopped or restarted.
under the hood: the RAM state is written into a file in the EBS volume(root).
the root EBS volume is encrypted.

use cases:
long running processing
saving the RAM state
services that take time to initialize.

an instance cannot be hibernated more than 60 days.

uptime shows how long the instance has been running since its last restart
uptime runs since the instance was never stopped but hibernated.
