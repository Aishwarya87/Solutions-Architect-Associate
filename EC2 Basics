1) ec2= IAAS = Elastic Compute Cloud
2) Consists of: Renting VMs, store data on virtual drives(EBS), distribute load across machines(ELB), scale services using an auto-scaling group(ASG)
3) Bootstrapping: launching commands when a machine starts. script is only run once at the instance first start.
4) The ec2 user data script runs with the root user(sudo command).
5) ec2 instance types: t2.micro, t2.xlarge

Deployment
1) Launch an AMI(amazon machine image). Can also create our own AMI's.
2) Configure Instance Details: Enter user data: the script launched at the boot of the instance; userdata.sh
3) The security rule 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 will allow traffic from everywhere.
4) Select a key pair: to login into the instance.
5) Tags give the name to the instance.
 
Cloud allows to be flexible and gets computing power very quickly
5) copy and paste the public ipv4 ip.
6) Started a web server on our ec2 instance using the script on the user data.
7) Used a public ip to access the web server.
8) Instance termination: deletion.
9) If you stop and then start the instance again, the public ipv4 changes.


Instance Types
Naming Convention  m5.2xlarge; m= instance class; 5=generation; 2xlarge= size within the instance class== more memory; more CPU; 
1) General purpose: eg: t2.micro
2) Compute Optimized: tasks that require high performance processors. eg: C4, C5a, C6g
3) Memory Optimized: process large data sets; databases, big unstructured data; eg: R6g series where R stands for RAM
4) Storage Optimized: OLTP systems( online transaction processing). data warehousing applications, distributed systems; eg: I,D,H1
