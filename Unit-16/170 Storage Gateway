aws is pushing for hybrid cloud.

Block Storage:
  EBS
  ec2 instance store
  
file Storage:
  EFS
  FSx
  
object storage:
  amazon s3
  amazon glacier
  
AWS storage gateways:
  File gateway:
    Integrated w ACTIVE DIRECTORY(AD) for user authentication.
    Configured s3 buckets are accessible using the NFS and SMB protocol.
    
  Volume Gateway:
    cached volumes: low latency access to most recent data.
    stored volume: entire dataset is on premise; scheduled backups on s3.
    block storage using iSCSI protocol backed by s3.
    snapshots of s3 as well.
  
  
  Tape gateway:
    Virtual tapes stored in s3. archived tapes in glacier.
    
  Storage gateway- hardware appliance:
    works with the abive mentioned gateways.
    where you do not have virtualization.
    
    
 On premises data to the cloud => Storage gateway
 
 file access/NFS - user auth with AD  => file gateway(backed by s3).
 volumes/block storage/ Iscsi => volume gateway
