User Based: IAM policies

Resource Based: 
bucket policies
Object ACL(Access Control List)
Bucket ACL

an IAM principal can access an s3 object if 
the user IAM permissions allow it OR the resource policy allows it
AND there's no explicit DENY.


Bucket Policies were created to prevent company data leaks.

User Security:
  Pre-signed urls: urls are valid only for a limited time.(ex: premium video service for logged in users).
  
If you get a 403(Forbidden) error, make sure the bucket policy allows public reads!
