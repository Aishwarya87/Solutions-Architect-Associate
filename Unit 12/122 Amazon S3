infinitely scaling storage.

globally unique.

objects(files) have a key. 
the key is the FULL PATH.
the key is composed of prefix+object name:

Versioning: enabled at the BUCKET LEVEL.

4 methods of encrypting objects:
  SSE-S3:keys handles and managed by AWS.
         object is encrypted server side.
         AES-256 encryption type.
         Must set header : "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"AES256"
         s3 managed data key
  
  SSE-KMS: keys handled and managed by KMS.
           advantages: user control+audit trial
           object is encrypted server side.
           Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption":"awskms"
           KMS Customer Master Key(CMK)
  
  SSE-C: manage your own encryption keys. managed by the customer outside of AWS.
         HTTPS MUST BE USED.
         encryption key must be provided in HTTP Headers, for every HTTP request made.
         
  Client Side Encryption: client must encrypt data themselves before sending to S3.
                          clients must decrypt data themselves after retrieval.
                          customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle.
                          HTTP or HTTPS.
                          
 Amazon S3 exposes:
 HTTP endpoint: non encrypted
 HTTPS endpoint: encryption in flight (SSL/TLS)
