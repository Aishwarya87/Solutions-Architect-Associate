SSE-S3
2

Client Side Encryption

With Client Side Encryption you perform the encryption yourself and send the encrypted data to AWS directly. AWS does not know your encryption keys and cannot decrypt your data.


Question 7




The bucket policy allows our users to read/write files in the bucket, yet we were not able to perform a PutObject API call.

1
The bucket policy must be wrong
2
The IAM user must have an explicit DENY in the attached IAM policy
3
You need to contact AWS Support to lift this limit

The IAM user must have an explicit DENY in the attached IAM policy

Explanation

Explicit DENY in an IAM policy will take precedence over a bucket policy permission

The Bucket policy is wrong
2
The IAM policy is wrong
