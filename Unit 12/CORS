Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
WEB BROWSER based mechanism to allow requests to other origins while visiting the main origin.

same origin: https://example.com/app1
             https://example.com/app2

different origins: https://example.com
                   https://other.example.com
                   
The requests wont be fulfilled unless the other region allows for the requests using CORS Headers(ex: access control allow region).

web browser makes a preflight request to the cross origin and gets a preflight response and that determines if the web browser can make requests or not.

S3 cors:
    if a client makes a cross origin request on the s3 bucket,  we need to enable the correct CORS headers.
    
    You can allow for a specific origin or * for all origins.
