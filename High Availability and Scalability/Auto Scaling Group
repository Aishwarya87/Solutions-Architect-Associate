scale out in- numbers
Metrics are computed for the overall ASG instances. 
Alarms: 
add/ decrease number of instances for a load balancer.

Scaling Policies can be on CPU, network;
IAM roles are attached to an ASG will get attached to the EC2 instances.

EXTRA SAFETY with ASG:
having instances under ASG means if they get terminated for whatever reason, the ASG will automaticaly create new ones as a replacement.

DYNAMIC SCALING POLICIES:
  Target Tracking Scaling: avg CPU around 40%
  Simple/ Step Scaling: cpu>70% add two units
  
  SCHEDULED ACTIONS: on friday
  
Predictive Scaling: 
  
Good metrics to scale on:
  CPU Utilization: 
  RequestCountPerTarget
  Average Ntwork In/Out
  Any Custom Metric
  
After a scaling activity happens, you are in the cooldown period(default 300 seconds). During this, the ASG will not launch or terminate additional instances.

Alarms: Alarm high: to scale out; Alarm low: to reduce instances

ASG DEFAULT TERMINATION POLICY:
By default, ASG tries to balance the number of instances acorss AZ.

LIFECYCLE HOOKS: ability to perform extra steps before the instance goes in service(pending state) or before termination.

LAUNCH TEMPLATE(newer) VERSUS LAUNCH CONFIG(legacy):
  launch template is recommended by AWS
