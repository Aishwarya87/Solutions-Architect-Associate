Scalability means that an applocation can handle greater loads by adapting.

SCALABILITY IS LINKED BUT DIFFERENT TO HIGH AVAILABILITY.

Vertical scalability: increase the size of the instance(scale up down)
Horizontal: increase the number of instances.(scale in out); autoscaling group; load balancer 

High Availability: Run instances for the same application across multiple AZ.
