Networking has two ips:
ipv4 and ipv6(3ffe)

ipv6 is newer and is used in IoT.
ipv4 from 0-255.

Public versus private IP:
Public IP means the machine can be identified on the internet(www)
must be unique across the whole web( no two machines can have the same public IP).
can be geo-located easily.

Private IP:
the machine can only be identified on a private network.
the ip must be unique across the private network.
two diff private networks(two companies) can have the same ips.
machines connect to www using an internet gateway(a proxy).
only some ips can be used as a private ip.


When you stop and start an ec2 instance, it can change its public ip.
if you need to have a fixed public ip for your instance, you need an elastic ip.
you can attach it to one instance at a time.
can only have 5 elastic ip in your account.

Instead, we can use a random public IP and register a DNS name to it.
or can use a load balancer and not use a public IP.

By default, ec2 instance comes with : private IP for the internal AWS network, a public ip for www.
when we are doing ssh, cant have a private ip because we are not in the same network.
