Buckets are global and non-regional. s3 replicates data across at least 3AZs to ensure 99.99% availability and 11'9s of durability.

Object Based Storage: opposed to other storage architectures.

provides unlimited storage.

S3 object: can store data from 0Bytes to 5TeraBytes in size
Buckets hold objects.

For Cheaper Storage: Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive(Cheapest) 

One Zone IA has less availability than standard, intelligent Tiering and Standard IA.

Security: All new buckets are PRIVATE when created by default. Access contol is configured using Access Control Lists and Bucket Policies(json document).

Encryption: 
Encryption in Transit
Traffic between local host and S3 is achieved via SSL/TLS. 
encryption at rest
SSE. SSE-AES, SSE-KMS,SSE-C
client side encryption
manually

Data Consistency: 
New Object(PUTS) - Read after write consistency or immediate
Overwrite(PUTS) or Delete objects(DELETES) - eventual consistency

Cross Region Replication: 
when enabled, any object that is uploaded will be AUTOMATICALLY REPLICATED to other regions. 

S3 Versioning:
Before versioning: null
After versioning: specific version ID. 
Once enabled, cannot be disabled, only suspended.

Lifecycle management: after 7days, move to glacier , after 365 days permanently delete. 
can be used together with versioning. objects can be moved between storage classes using this rule.

Transfer Acceleration:
distinct URL for fast and secure transer of files over long distances

Presigned URLs: 
to provide access to private objects.

MFA Delete:
Only the bucket owner logged in as ROOT USER can DELETE objects from bucket.
Must have versioning turned on to use.

Commands:
aws s3 ls bucketName/folderName/
aws s3 cp s3://bucketName/folder/pic.jpg ~/Desktop/pic.jpg  #to download
aws s3 cp ~/Desktop/pic.jpg s3://bucketName/folder/pic.jpg  #to upload in the list
