1) Expedited retrievals allow to access data in 1-5 minutes.
  vault lock and standard retrieval for3-5 hrs.
  bulk retrievals for 5-12 hours.
  
2) when the access patterns is changing and unpredictable, use s3 intelligent tiering storage class.

3) as per the best practice guidelines, db instances are placed in private subnets and allowed to communicate with web servers in the public subnet.

4) aws cognito service: login module; authentication; third party login such as fb, google, etc.

5) enable amazon redshift enhanced vpc routing for sending traffic through amazon vpc and not internet.

6) cognito identity supports guest users for the ability to enter the app and have limited access.

7) ensure an IAM role is attached to the lambda function which has the required DynamoDB privileges.

8) an alias record contains a pointer to a CF, elastic beanstalk environment, load balancers, etc.

9) for cost efficient and highly available, use s3 buckets.
  Storing files in EBS is not cost-efficient.
  glacier doesnot allow frequent access.
  instance store is not highly available compared with s3.
  
10) kinesis makes real time data ingestion easy. collect, process, analyze.

11) since web servers are part of the autoscaling group, the IP addresses of the instances can change. 
  hence, the web servers security group is placed as the source for the incoming rules in the database server security group.
  
12) ALB supports SNI(server name indication), enabling hosting multiple domain names with different TLS certificates behing a single ALB.

13) aws RAM[resource access manager]helps users to share resources with other accounts or organizations.

14) increase the autoscaling cooldown timer value to ensure that the scaling activity has sufficient time to stabilize without executing another scaling action.

15) VPC peering to establish connection between two vpcs; grant resource, communicate, send traffic.

16) get the snapshot of the current configuration using aws config.
