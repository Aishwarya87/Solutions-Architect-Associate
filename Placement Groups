Cluster: clusters instances into a low latency group, 10 Gbps network(bandwidth bw instances) in a single availability zone. same rack, same AZ
if the rack fails, all instances fail at the same time.
use case: big data job to complete fast
extremely low latency and high network throughput.
high performance application


Spread: minimize th failure risk.
all instances in different hardware.
span across AZ
limited to 7 instances per AZ per placement group.
use case:application that need to maximize high availability.
critical application.


Partition: hadoop, cassandra, kafka
upto 7 partitions per AZ.
upto 100s of ec2 instances.
a partition failure can affect ec2s but not other partitions.
distributed application
